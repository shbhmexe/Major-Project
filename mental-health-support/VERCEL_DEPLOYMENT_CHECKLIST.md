## 🚀 Vercel Deployment Steps

### 1. Repository Setup
```bash
# Ensure latest code is pushed to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Final build - Assessment priority flow ready for production"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Vercel Dashboard Configuration
1. **Import Project**: Connect your GitHub repository
2. **Framework Preset**: Next.js (auto-detected)
3. **Build Settings**: 
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

### 3. Environment Variables
Set these in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:

```env
# Required Environment Variables
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret_here
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_oauth_secret
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key

# Optional but Recommended
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 4. Deploy
- Click **Deploy** button in Vercel
- Wait for build completion (should take 2-3 minutes)
- Verify deployment URL works

## 🧪 Post-Deployment Testing

### User Flow Testing
1. **Visit deployed URL**
2. **Sign up/Login** with test credentials
3. **Verify automatic redirect** to `/assessment`
4. **Complete PHQ-9 assessment** (test different score ranges)
5. **Complete GAD-7 assessment** (test different score ranges)
6. **Check results display** with proper scoring
7. **Test Emergency SOS** button (should appear for scores ≥10)
8. **Click "Continue to Platform"** → Should redirect to homepage
9. **Verify platform features** are now accessible

### Emergency Integration Testing
Test these score scenarios:
- **Low scores (0-4)**: No SOS button
- **Mild scores (5-9)**: No SOS button
- **Moderate scores (10-14)**: SOS button appears
- **Severe scores (15+)**: SOS button appears
- **SOS button click**: Should open dialer with `1800-599-0019`

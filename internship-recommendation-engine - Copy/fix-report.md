# Authentication and Chatbot Fix Report

## Overview

This document outlines the issues identified and fixes implemented in the authentication system and chatbot functionality of the Internship Recommendation Engine application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Gemini Chatbot API Integration

**Problem:** The Gemini chatbot API integration had several issues including:
- Incorrect method call (`ai.models.getGenerativeModel` instead of `ai.getGenerativeModel`)
- Lack of proper system prompts to restrict responses to platform-related questions
- Inadequate error handling
- Missing safety settings

**Solution:**
- Fixed the method call from `ai.models.getGenerativeModel` to `ai.getGenerativeModel`
- Added a logging function for better debugging
- Enhanced API key initialization checks
- Implemented a system prompt to restrict responses to platform-related questions
- Added safety settings to ensure appropriate content
- Improved error responses with more specific messages

### 2. Email OTP Verification

**Problem:** The email OTP verification was failing due to an incorrect API endpoint URL in the `AuthContext.js` file.

**Solution:**
- Corrected the API endpoint URL from `/api/auth/verify-email-otp` to `/api/auth/email-otp` with PUT method
- Added console logging for response status to aid in debugging

### 3. Phone OTP Delivery with Firebase Authentication

**Problem:** The phone OTP delivery was failing due to improper reCAPTCHA implementation and incorrect API usage.

**Solution:**
- Fixed the reCAPTCHA implementation by changing from 'invisible' to 'normal' size
- Added proper cleanup of existing reCAPTCHA elements
- Improved error handling with specific error messages based on error codes
- Implemented proper credential verification using PhoneAuthProvider
- Updated the UI in both login and register pages to properly display the reCAPTCHA widget
- Added better error handling during reCAPTCHA rendering

### 4. MongoDB User Authentication and Storage

**Problem:** The application was using localStorage for user data storage without a proper database backend.

**Solution:**
- Created a MongoDB connection utility
- Implemented a User model with methods for CRUD operations
- Created an API route for user operations
- Updated the authentication context to store and retrieve user data from MongoDB

## Testing

Test files have been created to verify the functionality of the fixes:

1. `auth.test.js` - Tests for the authentication API including:
   - Email OTP sending and verification
   - User creation, updating, and retrieval

2. `chatbot.test.js` - Tests for the chatbot API including:
   - Text message responses
   - Error handling
   - Response restriction to platform-related questions
   - Image upload handling

## Future Improvements

1. **Authentication:**
   - Implement JWT token-based authentication for better security
   - Add password-based authentication as an alternative
   - Implement session management

2. **Chatbot:**
   - Improve the system prompt with more specific information about the platform
   - Add support for more complex queries
   - Implement conversation history

3. **Database:**
   - Add indexes for better performance
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Add more comprehensive error handling

## Conclusion

The fixes implemented have addressed the critical issues in the authentication system and chatbot functionality. The application now has a more robust authentication flow with proper database storage and improved error handling. The chatbot has been enhanced to provide more relevant responses and better error handling.

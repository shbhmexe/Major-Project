DATA DASHBOARD APPLICATION - HOW EVERYTHING WORKS

Application Initialization and Startup

1. The application starts with the Next.js framework bootstrapping the app from the next.config.mjs file
2. The root layout.js file loads first, which sets up:
   - Font configuration (Geist and Geist_Mono)
   - Global CSS styling from globals.css
   - The AppProvider for authentication and user state
   - The ThemeProvider for light/dark theme management
   - The MainLayout component that structures the entire application

3. Initial state is loaded from localStorage if available:
   - User authentication state
   - Previously visited path
   - Theme preferences

Authentication System

1. User Authentication Flow:
   - When a user visits a protected route, the app checks authentication status
   - If not authenticated, the user is redirected to the login page
   - Login form collects email and password
   - Form validation checks for valid input format
   - On submission, the login function from AppContext is called
   - User data is stored in context state and localStorage
   - User is redirected to their previously visited page or dashboard

2. Registration Flow:
   - New users can toggle to registration form
   - Name, email, and password are collected
   - Form validation ensures proper format
   - On submission, user data is stored similar to login flow
   - New user is redirected to dashboard

3. Authentication State Management:
   - AppContext maintains authentication state globally
   - Protected routes check this state before rendering
   - User data persists through browser refreshes via localStorage

Theme System

1. Theme Initialization:
   - ThemeContext checks localStorage for saved theme preference
   - If none exists, it detects system preference using matchMedia API
   - Appropriate CSS classes (dark: variants) are applied to HTML element
   - Theme state is stored in context

2. Theme Toggle:
   - User can toggle theme via header button
   - Toggle function in ThemeContext switches isDarkMode state
   - New preference is saved to localStorage
   - CSS classes are updated on HTML element

3. Theme Application:
   - Tailwind's dark mode classes are used throughout the application
   - Components use conditional classes like "text-gray-900 dark:text-white"
   - Transition effects ensure smooth theme changes

Navigation and Routing

1. Route Structure:
   - Next.js App Router uses directory-based routing
   - Each route folder (login, dashboard, analytics, etc.) has a page.js file
   - The page.js file exports the React component for that route
   - Dynamic routes use [param] folder naming convention

2. Navigation Components:
   - Sidebar component contains main navigation links
   - Each link uses Next.js Link component for client-side navigation
   - Active route is highlighted with special styling
   - Mobile view has a collapsible sidebar with overlay

3. Navigation State:
   - Current path is tracked in AppContext
   - Last visited path is saved for better user experience after login
   - Programmatic navigation uses useRouter hook from Next.js

Layout System

1. Main Layout Structure:
   - MainLayout component in src/components/layout/MainLayout.js handles overall structure
   - Fixed header at the top
   - Sidebar on the left (responsive)
   - Main content area that adapts based on sidebar state
   - Mobile menu button in the bottom right corner

2. Header Component:
   - Contains user profile information
   - Theme toggle button
   - Notification indicators
   - User dropdown menu with logout option

3. Responsive Behavior:
   - Sidebar is always visible on desktop (>768px)
   - Sidebar collapses on tablet and mobile
   - Toggle button shows/hides sidebar on mobile
   - Overlay dims background when sidebar is open on mobile

Data Flow and State Management

1. Global State:
   - AppContext manages authentication and user data
   - ThemeContext manages theme preferences
   - Both use React Context API for global state access

2. Local Component State:
   - Individual components use useState hook for local state
   - Form components manage their own form state and validation
   - UI components manage their interaction states (open/closed, selected, etc.)

3. Data Fetching Pattern:
   - Currently using mock data
   - Prepared for real API implementation with proper structure
   - Components can fetch data on mount using useEffect
   - Loading states are managed in component state

Dashboard Page

1. Structure and Components:
   - Statistics cards at the top show key metrics
   - Recent activity feed in the middle left
   - Quick actions panel on the right
   - Clear section division with responsive grid layout

2. Functionality:
   - Dashboard checks authentication state on load
   - Redirects to login if user is not authenticated
